# SOC-SIEM

This project demonstrates a basic Security Operations Center (SOC) built using Microsoft Azure. It ingests Windows security logs into Microsoft Sentinel, creates analytics rules, and visualizes security events using dashboards. The goal is to demonstrate hands-on experience with cloud security monitoring and SIEM concepts.
